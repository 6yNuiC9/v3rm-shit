# (Slightly) Better V3rm

A tampermonkey script for vermillon.net. Adds a few new features and some styling things.

Looking at v3rm alot for roblox stuff, I figured that I might as well take a shot at making it look better and probably adding a few new features and stuff along the way

(including easter eggs :) )
